I'm currently the malaria vector surveillance lead at the [Wellcome Sanger
Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/)'s Genomic Surveillance Unit. My role involves the design and
implementation of genomic surveillance systems to monitor and track
changes in populations of the mosquitoes that transmit malaria in
Africa.

From 2009-2021 I worked on malaria genomics at the [University of
Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/) initially at the [Wellcome Centre for
Human Genetics](https://www.well.ox.ac.uk/) and later at the [Big Data
Institute](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk). 

From 2008-2009 I worked at the [Department of
Zoology](https://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/) at the [University of
Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/), applying Semantic Web technologies to
problems in biological data integration.

From 2002-2008 I worked at the [Rutherford Appleton
Laboratory](https://stfc.ukri.org/about-us/where-we-work/rutherford-appleton-laboratory/)
as part of the e-Science Centre, developing new Web technologies for
published, sharing and linking data.

I hold a [doctor of philosophy](https://github.com/alimanfoo/dphil/) degree from the University of Oxford, a masters degree in Web Technology
from Oxford Brookes University, and a bachelors degree in Natural Sciences (Part II Zoology) from
the University of Cambridge.
