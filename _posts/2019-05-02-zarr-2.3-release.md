*This article was originally posted on the [Zarr
blog](https://zarr-developers.github.io/zarr/python/release/2019/05/23/zarr-2.3-release.html).*

Recently we released version 2.3 of the [Python Zarr
package](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which implements the
Zarr protocol for storing N-dimensional typed arrays, and is designed
for use in distributed and parallel computing. This post provides an
overview of new features in this release, and some information about
future directions for Zarr.

## New storage options for distributed and cloud computing

A key feature of the Zarr protocol is that the underlying storage
system is decoupled from other components via a simple key/value
interface. In Python, this interface corresponds to the
[`MutableMapping`
interface](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-mapping),
which is the interface that Python
[`dict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict)
implements. I.e., anything `dict`-like can be used to store Zarr
data. The simplicity of this interface means it is relatively
straightforward to add support for a range of different storage
systems. The 2.3 release adds support for storage using [SQLite](
https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/storage.html#zarr.storage.SQLiteStore
), [Redis](
https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/storage.html#zarr.storage.RedisStore
), [MongoDB](
https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/storage.html#zarr.storage.MongoDBStore
) and [Azure Blob Storage](
https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/storage.html#zarr.storage.ABSStore
).

For example, here's code that creates an array using MongoDB:

{% highlight python %}
import zarr
store = zarr.MongoDBStore('localhost')
root = zarr.group(store=store, overwrite=True)
foo = bar.create_group('foo')
bar = foo.create_dataset('bar', shape=(10000, 1000), chunks=(1000, 100))
bar[:] = 42
store.close()
{% endhighlight %}

To do the same thing but storing the data in the cloud via Azure
Blob Storage, replace the instantiation of the `store` object with:

{% highlight python %}
store = zarr.ABSStore(container='test', account_name='foo', account_key='bar')
{% endhighlight %}

Support for other cloud object storage storage services was already
available via other packages, with Amazon S3 supported via the [s3fs](
http://s3fs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ ) package, and Google Cloud
Storage supported via the [gcsfs](
https://gcsfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ ) package. Further notes on
using cloud storage are available from the [Zarr
tutorial](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial.html#distributed-cloud-storage).

The attraction of cloud storage is that total I/O bandwidth scales
linearly with the size of a computing cluster, so there are no
technical limits to the size of the data or computation you can scale
up to. Here's a slide from a recent presentation by [Ryan
Abernathey](https://github.com/rabernat) showing how I/O scales when
using Zarr over Google Cloud Storage:

<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-slide="22" data-id="1621118c5987411fb55fdcf503cb331d" data-ratio="1.77777777777778" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>

## Optimisations for cloud storage: consolidated metadata

One issue with using cloud object storage is that, although total I/O
throughput can be high, the latency involved in each request to read
the contents of an object can be >100 ms, even when reading from
compute nodes within the same data centre. This latency can add up
when reading metadata from many arrays, because in Zarr each array has
its own metadata stored in a separate object.

To work around this, the 2.3 release adds an experimental feature to
consolidate metadata for all arrays and groups within a hierarchy into
a single object, which can be read once via a single request. Although
this is not suitable for rapidly changing datasets, it can be good for
large datasets which are relatively static.

To use this feature, two new convenience functions have been
added. The
[`consolidate_metadata()`](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/convenience.html#zarr.convenience.consolidate_metadata)
function performs the initial consolidation, reading all metadata and
combining them into a single object. Once you have done that and
deployed the data to a cloud object store, the
[`open_consolidated()`](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/convenience.html#zarr.convenience.open_consolidated)
function can be used to read data, making use of the consolidated
metadata.

Support for the new consolidated metadata feature is also now
available via
[xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.open_zarr.html)
and
[intake-xarray](https://intake-xarray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
(see [this blog
post](https://www.anaconda.com/intake-taking-the-pain-out-of-data-access/)
for an introduction to intake), and many of the datasets in [Pangeo's
cloud data catalog](https://pangeo-data.github.io/pangeo-datastore/)
use Zarr with consolidated metadata.

Here's an example of how to open a Zarr dataset from Pangeo's data
catalog via intake:

{% highlight python %}
import intake
cat_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-datastore/master/intake-catalogs/master.yaml'
cat = intake.Catalog(cat_url)
ds = cat.atmosphere.gmet_v1.to_dask()
{% endhighlight %}

...and [here's the underlying catalog
entry](https://github.com/pangeo-data/pangeo-datastore/blob/aa3f12bcc3be9584c1a9071235874c9d6af94a4e/intake-catalogs/atmosphere.yaml#L6).


## Compatibility with N5

Around the same time that development on Zarr was getting started, a
separate team led by [Stephan Saafeld](https://github.com/axtimwalde)
at the Janelia research campus was experiencing similar challenges
storing and computing with large amounts of neural imaging data, and
developed a software library called
[N5](https://github.com/saalfeldlab/n5). N5 is implemented in Java but
is very similar to Zarr in the approach it takes to storing both
metadata and data chunks, and to decoupling the storage backend to
enable efficient use of cloud storage.

There is a lot of commonality between Zarr and N5 and we are working
jointly to bring the two approaches together. As a first experimental
step towards that goal, the Zarr 2.3 release includes an [N5 storage
adapter](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/n5.html#zarr.n5.N5Store)
which allows reading and writing of data on disk in the N5
format. 


## Support for the buffer protocol

Zarr is intended to work efficiently across a range of different
storage systems with different latencies and bandwidth, from cloud
object stores to local disk and memory. In many of these settings,
making efficient use of local memory, and avoiding memory copies
wherever possible, can make a substantial difference to
performance. This is particularly true within the
[Numcodecs](http://numcodecs.rtfd.io) package, which is a companion to
Zarr and provides implementations of compression and filter codecs
such as Blosc and Zstandard. A key aspect of achieving fewer memory
copies has been to leverage the Python buffer protocol.

The [Python buffer
protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html) is a
specification for how to share large blocks of memory between
different libraries without copying. This protocol has evolved over
time from its original introduction in Python 2 and later revamped
implementation added in Python 3 (with backports to Python 2.6 and
2.7). Due to the changes in its behavior from Python 2 to Python 3 and
what objects supported which implementation of the buffer protocol, it
was a bit challenging to leverage effectively in Zarr.

Thanks to some under-the-hood changes in Zarr 2.3 and Numcodecs 0.6,
the buffer protocol is now cleanly supported for Python 2/3 in both
libraries when working with data. In addition to improved memory
handling and performance, this should make it easier for users
developing their own stores, compressors, and filters to use with
Zarr. Also it has cutdown on the amount of code specialized for
handling different Python versions.


## Future developments

There is a growing community of interest around new approaches to
storage of array-like data, particularly in the cloud. For example,
[Theo McCaie](https://github.com/tam203) from the UK Met Office
Informatics Lab recently wrote a series of blog posts about the
challenges involved in [storing 200TB of "high momentum" weather model
data every
day](https://medium.com/informatics-lab/creating-a-data-format-for-high-momentum-datasets-a394fa48b671). This
is an exciting space to be working in and we'd like to do what we can
to build connections and share knowledge and ideas between
communities. We've started a [regular
teleconference](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr/issues/315)
which is open to anyone to join, and there is a new [gitter
channel](https://gitter.im/zarr-developers/community) for general
discussion.

The main focus of our conversations so far has been setting up work
towards development of a new set of specifications that support the
features of both Zarr and N5, and provide a platform for exploration
and development of new features, while also identifying a minimal core
protocol that can be implemented in a range of different programming
languages. It is still relatively early days and there are lots of
open questions to work through, both on the technical side and in
terms of how we organise and coordinate efforts. However, the
community is very friendly and supportive, and anyone is welcome to
participate, so if you have an interest please do consider getting
involved.

If you would like to stay in touch with or contribute to new
developments, keep an eye on the
[zarr](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr) and
[zarr-specs](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-specs) GitHub
repositories, and please feel free to raise issues or add comments if
you have any questions or ideas.


## And finally... SciPy!

If you're coming to SciPy this year, we're very pleased to be giving a
talk on Zarr on [day 1 of the conference (Wednesday 10
July)](https://www.eiseverywhere.com/ehome/381993). Several members of
the Zarr community will be at the conference, and there are sprints
going on after the conference in a number of related areas, including
an Xarray sprint on the Saturday. Please do say hi or [drop us a
comment on this
issue](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr/issues/396) if you'd
like to connect and discuss anything.
