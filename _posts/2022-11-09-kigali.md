Conference trips are a wonderful opportunity for reflection. They take
you out of the daily grind, temporarily break you free of meetings,
deadlines, deliverables, emails. Travel and transit give you time and
space, moments where all you can do is sit still and allow yourself to
be transported from one place to another. Looking down at the Earth's
surface from 40,000 feet, watching the drama and collision of
landscape and humanity from a distance, rekindles a sense of
perspective. And arriving in an unfamiliar place where differences in
food, clothes, language and culture, even if only subtle, all
help to burst the bubble of ordinary life.

Conferences themselves are always energising. Meeting new people,
absorbing new ideas, feeling new influences, glimpsing new
opportunities and challenges. Before long the mind hits
overload, which then interacts with too much coffee and
alcohol and a deficit of sleep to create a heightened state of
consciousness where anything seems possible. If you're fortunate, a
friendly conference veteran recognises the glazed look in your eyes and
takes you out for a walk or a run to help you reset and refresh, ready
for more inputs.

The last two and a half years have been hard. Securities I took for granted cracked and crumbled. At
work and at home I hit unfamiliar challenges. And many people I know seem to be in a similar boat, trying to
weather their own storm.

The [Pan-African Mosquito Control Association (PAMCA) conference in
September 2022](https://conference2022.pamca.org/) was my first
conference after the pandemic. Held in Kigali, Rwanda, it brought
everything I could ask for in a conference. Over and above
the usual conference experience, there was a great sense of
reunion, of seeing friends again for the first time in 3 or more
years. And the spirit of the conference is strong, everyone shares
a common purpose and is ready to celebrate each others'
achievements. Mix in a generous portion of African hospitality,
colour, music and fun, and you're there.

Outside of the conference, two other experiences left their mark.

The first was an invitation to a fund-raising dinner at [Maison
Shalom](https://maisonshalom.org/), a charity supporting Burundian
refugees in Rwanda. I got to visit the site of a new school being built for
refugee children, and hear the story of strength and determination
that forged the charity out of unimaginable sorrow. All of us there had been invited by a Burundian colleague with a personal
connection to the charity, and with humility and humour
he shared his story and made us all feel connected.

The second was a visit to the Genocide Memorial in Kigali. I tried not
to lose myself in the horror but learn as much as I could about the
circumstances that led to the genocide. Afterwards I read "Shaking Hands with the Devil", an account of the genocide written
by the commander of the UN peacekeeping force deployed in Rwanda at
the time. Both the memorial and the book confront you with the brutal
reality of what we are capable of, but also how the international community really works. 

But the visit to the memorial also gave me a gift, and that was a
word: ubumuntu. Ubumuntu is a Kinyarwandan word translating roughly as
"kindness", "generosity" or "greatness of heart". It's the word
chosen to name a [programme of education](https://ubumuntu.rw/) to
promote peace in Rwanda following the genocide. It is also the name
chosen for [a
documentary](https://genocidearchiverwanda.org.rw/index.php/Ubumuntu)
about people who risked their lives to save others during the
genocide. Ubumuntu is called "ubuntu" in some other African languages,
and I knew this word already of course because it is the name of the
operating system on my computer. I had a superficial sense of what
ubuntu meant before, but as ubumuntu it now has a deeper meaning.

Returning home, I was of course delighted to see my family again, but
also confronted with all of life's challenges that had only been
put on pause, patiently waiting for my return. But the
experience of Kigali stays with me, and gives me strength and resolve to move forward. 
Thank you to all the wonderful people who helped to make it happen!
