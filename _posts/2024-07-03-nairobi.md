title: Arthropod Genomics Symposium 2024
---

I felt very lucky to attend the Arthropod Genomics Symposium in
Nairobi last week. The scientific talks were excellent, and there
aren't many other meetings where you get the same crossover of folks
working on disease vectors, agricultural pests and species in need of
conservation - three different fields of applied genomics but lots of
common challenges and new ideas. The last AGS I attended was in 2017
and so it was wonderful to reconnect and see how much things have
progressed.

I presented on accelerating genomic surveillance of malaria vectors in
Africa. More than 23,000 African Anopheles genomes have now been
sequenced through concerted efforts by MalariaGEN, PAMCA, GAARD,
Target Malaria, PAMGEN and many others. The main question is, wow can
we now build on this to address the challenges of resistance to dual
AI LLINs and other evolutionary threats to vector control? [My slides

I also compiled a [thread with highlights from all the other
talks](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1808462832981209397.html),
with links to papers where I could find them. Looking forward to the
next AGS!
