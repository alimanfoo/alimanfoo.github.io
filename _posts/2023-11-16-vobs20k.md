Thanks to the concerted efforts of many different contributing studies
and institutions, the [Malaria Vector Genome
Observatory](https://www.malariagen.net/vobs/) now contains
analysis-ready data from whole-genome sequencing of 22,015 *Anopheles*
mosquitoes. Within the last 12 months, more than 10,000 new genomes
were added, doubling the total size of the data resource. The first
data were also added for mosquitoes from the *Anopheles funestus*
species subgroup, now accounting for 3,038 genomes.

To mark this milestone, here are three new visualisations of the data.

The first is a network depicting genetic relationships between
mosquitoes from the Anopheles gambiae species complex. Each point
represents a mosquito genome coloured by species. Each mosquito is
connected to two other mosquitoes which are the closest in terms of
genetic distance. The video shows an animation of this network being
laid out using a force-directed graph.

I also created an [alternative video showing the network using a
different layout algorithm](https://youtu.be/BJA9QeUJAZg).

The second visualisation is a timeline showing when data releases
where made available to contributing partner studies and how many
mosquitoes each release contains. Data generation has accelerated
particularly since 2020, thanks to support from the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation and Wellcome.

The third visualisation is a map showing the geographical coverage of
sampling locations in Africa. Each location is represented by a pie
chart showing the number of samples by species. Data are available
from 29 African countries, and a growing number of countries are now
represented by longitudinal and subnational sampling.

A huge thank you to everyone who has supported and contributed to
creating this data resource. So many people have gone to great
lengths, overcome significant challenges and shown extraordinary
patience, dedication and generosity to make this possible.
