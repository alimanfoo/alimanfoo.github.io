I'm very fortunate to lead a small but perfectly-formed team of
lovely, talented and very dedicated people at the Sanger Institute
Genomic Surveillance Unit, together with visiting fellows and students
from other institutes.

We aren't a conventional research group because a major focus of our
work is scientific capacity-building, i.e., providing support and
creating resources and tools that enable others to do great science
and apply it to infectious disease surveillance. Academic publications
are not our primary focus, we gauge our success by the scientific
outputs and impact of our partners and collaborators, who are mainly
based in Africa. Our work is a blend of collaborative science, data
and software engineering, training and knowledge-transfer. We work
extensively with other teams within GSU and with many other scientific
groups in both the northern and southern hemispheres.
