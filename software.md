I'm passionate about open source software and a big fan of the Python
scientific computing ecosystem and community. Below are some of the
open source projects I've initiated and played a major part in
developing.

* [malariagen_data](https://github.com/malariagen/malariagen-data-python) - A Python package providing a cloud-native interface for accessing
  and interactively analysing genomic data from the [Malaria Vector
  Genome Observatory](https://www.malariagen.net/vobs/).

* [zarr-python](https://github.com/zarr-developers/zarr-python) - a
  Python package providing an implementation of compressed, chunked,
  N-dimensional arrays, designed for use in parallel computing.

* [scikit-allel](https://github.com/cggh/scikit-allel) - a Python
  package for exploratory analysis of large scale genetic variation
  data.

* [pysamstats](https://github.com/alimanfoo/pysamstats) - a fast
  Python and command-line utility for extracting simple statistics
  against genome positions based on sequence alignments from a SAM or
  BAM file.

* [petl](https://github.com/petl-developers/petl) - a general purpose
  Python package for extracting, transforming and loading tables of
  data. This was my first foray into open source software.
