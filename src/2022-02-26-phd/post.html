<p>Today I finally graduated as a Doctor of Philosophy. It was a beautiful sunny winter's day in Oxford, and I got to share the experience with my wife and eldest daughter. It was a real treat.</p>

<p>When I originally enrolled as a PhD student, I was 37 years old, with one daughter and a full-time job. The logic was that I could keep the job and do the PhD at the same time, because I was already working in a scientific position, and so I should be able to re-use a lot of the work I was doing anyway for a thesis. It sounded great in theory.</p>
