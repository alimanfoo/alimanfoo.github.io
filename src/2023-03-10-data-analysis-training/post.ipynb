    "Part of our mission is to make malaria genomics as accessible as possible. Over the past year my team and I have been working hard to develop a training course that introduces scientists to the elements of mosquito genomic data analysis. The goal was to create a course that can help someone get as quickly as possible from little or no prior experience of genomic data analysis to a point where they can independently plan and run a suite of common analysis methods required for surveillance of mosquito populations. Along the way, we have been delivering the course as a series of 8 one-day online workshops to a cohort of 50 African scientists. It's been a challenge because we've run one workshop every 6 weeks or so, developing the content for each workshop as we go. But we've finally come to the end and have a complete course of 8 workshops published via the course website. \n",
