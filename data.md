* [The *Anopheles gambiae* 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 SNP data
  resource](https://www.malariagen.net/data/ag1000g-phase3-snp) -
  Includes sample metadata, sequence read alignments and genome-wide
  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls from whole-genome
  sequencing of 2,784 wild-caught mosquitoes collected from 19
  countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and 297 mosquitoes comprising
  parents and progeny of 15 lab crosses. Three mosquito species are
  represented: *Anopheles gambiae*, *Anopheles coluzzii* and
  *Anopheles arabiensis*.

* [The *Anopheles gambiae* 1000 Genomes Project phase 2 data
  resource](https://www.malariagen.net/resource/27) - Includes sample
  metadata, sequence read alignments, genome-wide single nucleotide
  polymorphism (SNP) calls, SNP haplotypes and copy number variation
  (CNV) calls from whole-genome sequencing of 1,142 wild-caught
  mosquito specimens collected from 13 countries spanning sub-Saharan
  Africa, and 234 specimens comprising parents and progeny of 11 lab
  crosses. Two mosquito species are represented: *Anopheles gambiae*
  and *Anopheles coluzzii*.

* The *Anopheles gambiae* 1000 Genomes Project phase 1
  [SNP](https://www.malariagen.net/data/ag1000g-phase1-ar3) and
  [haplotype](https://www.malariagen.net/data/ag1000g-phase1-ar3.1)
  data resources, including variant calls and associated data from
  whole-genome sequencing of 845 mosquito specimens â€” 765 wild-caught
  specimens collected from eight countries across sub-Saharan Africa,
  and 80 specimens comprising parents and progeny of four crosses. Two
  mosquito species are represented: *Anopheles gambiae* and *Anopheles
  coluzzii*.

* [The MalariaGEN *Plasmodium falciparum* Genetic Crosses data
  resource](https://www.malariagen.net/data/pf-crosses-1.0) -
  Comprises sequence alignments, SNP calls, small indel calls and copy
  number variant calls from whole-genome sequencing of parents and 78
  progeny clones from the crosses 3D7xHB3, HB3xDd2 and 7G8xGB4.
