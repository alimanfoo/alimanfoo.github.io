I have a strong interest in building high quality open data resources
to power large-scale collaborative science. Below are genomic data
resources which I've played a significant part in creating.

* [The Malaria Vector Genome
  Observatory](https://www.malariagen.net/vobs/) - This resource
  includes data from whole-genome sequencing of more than 24,000
  individual *Anopheles* mosquitoes collected from 31 African
  countries. As far as I'm aware, it is currently the largest open
  dataset of natural genetic variation for any eukaryotic species
  other than humans. The Vector Observatory brings high quality genome
  variation data together with software tools and training resources
  to empower African scientists to lead research on mosquito ecology
  and evolution.

* [The *Anopheles gambiae* 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 SNP data
  resource](https://www.malariagen.net/data/ag1000g-phase3-snp) -
  Includes sample metadata, sequence read alignments and genome-wide
  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calls from whole-genome
  sequencing of 2,784 wild-caught mosquitoes collected from 19
  countries in sub-Saharan Africa, and 297 mosquitoes comprising
  parents and progeny of 15 lab crosses. Three mosquito species are
  represented: *Anopheles gambiae*, *Anopheles coluzzii* and
  *Anopheles arabiensis*.

* [The *Anopheles gambiae* 1000 Genomes Project phase 2 data
  resource](https://www.malariagen.net/resource/27) - Includes sample
  metadata, sequence read alignments, genome-wide single nucleotide
  polymorphism (SNP) calls, SNP haplotypes and copy number variation
  (CNV) calls from whole-genome sequencing of 1,142 wild-caught
  mosquito specimens collected from 13 countries spanning sub-Saharan
  Africa, and 234 specimens comprising parents and progeny of 11 lab
  crosses. Two mosquito species are represented: *Anopheles gambiae*
  and *Anopheles coluzzii*.

* The *Anopheles gambiae* 1000 Genomes Project phase 1
  [SNP](https://www.malariagen.net/data/ag1000g-phase1-ar3) and
  [haplotype](https://www.malariagen.net/data/ag1000g-phase1-ar3.1)
  data resources, including variant calls and associated data from
  whole-genome sequencing of 845 mosquito specimens â€” 765 wild-caught
  specimens collected from eight countries across sub-Saharan Africa,
  and 80 specimens comprising parents and progeny of four crosses. Two
  mosquito species are represented: *Anopheles gambiae* and *Anopheles
  coluzzii*.

* [The MalariaGEN *Plasmodium falciparum* Genetic Crosses data
  resource](https://www.malariagen.net/data/pf-crosses-1.0) -
  Comprises sequence alignments, SNP calls, small indel calls and copy
  number variant calls from whole-genome sequencing of parents and 78
  progeny clones from the crosses 3D7xHB3, HB3xDd2 and 7G8xGB4.
